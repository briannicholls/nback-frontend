# Dual n-Back Instructions

The 'Dual' in Dual n-Back stands for two stimuli.

Each turn, you will hear a sound and see a position on the grid light up.

The test begins at "1-back", i.e. "one turn ago".

When either stimulus is the same as "1-back" (one turn ago), press the corresponding key:

* A for audio match
* L for position match

**n** will increase as you get better. Be careful, you will lose points for incorrect guesses. Good luck!
